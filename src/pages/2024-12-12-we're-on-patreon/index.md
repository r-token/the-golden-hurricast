We're now offering a paid membership program through <a href="https://patreon.com/thegoldenhurricast" target="_blank">Patreon</a> that unlocks access to a ton of new content including our newsletter, advanced stat breakdowns, automatic NIL contributions, and much more.

It comes in three tiers:

<br />

<br />

<br />

Not gonna lie, the $25/month tier is mostly just there in case you really like us a lot and want to give us more than $10/month ðŸ˜¬

## Nothing is changing with the podcast

<br />

Everything we've done for the past seven years is staying the same. The podcast will still be free and ad-free, and there are no changes to the website. Everything behind the paid membership tiers is specifically additive.

<br />

## Why are we doing this?

<br />

We want to take this project to the next level, and we'd like your help to get there. Our goal is to expand the Hurricast universe into new kinds of content that you all will love.

Matt and I have been wanting to branch out into extra content beyond the podcast for a while now. The podcast itself, though, is already quite a bit of work. The podcast alone typically has me feeling pretty burnt out by the time our summer hiatus rolls around. Adding extra content onto that for free is a direct path to burnout, at least for me.

Adding a paid membership program will keep this thing rolling. It shows me that people care enough for us to create this new content. It creates a deeper community with the people who like what we're doing. Having support here is a significant motivator.

We're offering quite a bit of new content as part of this plan, and the paid members are the reason it exists.
