For better or for worse, the deed has been done. As of Saturday, March 12th, 2022, exactly one year after we wrote the blog post on [The Odd Case of Frank Haith](https://www.thegoldenhurricast.com/odd-case-frank-haith), Frank Haith has resigned and is no longer the head basketball coach at The University of Tulsa.

I put my [initial thoughts](https://twitter.com/GoldenHurricast/status/1502821181082189827?s=20&t=h3dZVXECBVYFRNa9aIIMvw) about this on Twitter, but an event like this deserves more thought, perspective, and room to breath.

Let me be clear: Frank Haith has been a fantastic representative and leader for TU over his eight years here. There has been no drama, no scandals, and no shortage of great memories with him at the helm. He's also represented a stable presence for a school that has gone through nonstop instability throughout effectively his entire tenure here.

<br />

#### So How Did We Get Here?

<br />

TU hired Frank Haith in April of 2014. Tulsa was coming off of an NCAA Tournament loss against UCLA, Danny Manning had just left for Wake Forest, Frank Haith had just completed his second 23-win season in a row at Mizzou, and Matt and I were about to complete our freshman years.

Born and raised in St. Louis, we both grew up Mizzou fans. Yes there was some drama near the end of Haith's tenure with the Tigers, but I (and I think Matt, too) were both optimistic about Haith's prospects at a school like TU. Tulsa was a lower-pressure job than Mizzou and in a lower-profile league, but was also a program with plenty of upside, recent success, and a stacked roster. The table was set nicely for Coach Haith to come in and succeed immediately.

And succeed he did – for a time. His first two seasons at Tulsa resulted in final KenPom rankings of 85 and 65, including an NCAA Tournament appearance in 2016. Those were the days of James Woodard, Shaq Harrison, Rashad Ray, and D'Andre Wright. Clear and obvious successful seasons, albeit with a roster that he did not recruit.

But then those guys all graduated, and the 2016-17 roster was completely different. Along with sophomore returner Sterling Taplin and freshman Martins Igbanu came a host of transfers including Junior Etou (Rutgers), Corey Henderson (Wichita State), and Jaleel Wheeler (JUCO). Pat Birt, another JUCO transfer, had arrived at TU the season prior. Due to the massive roster turnover, there was a significant drop during the 2016-17 season. Tulsa ended the year ranked #144 in KenPom.

From the 2016-17 season on, it becomes a roller coaster. Over the next several years we get to watch the rise of guys like DaQuan Jeffries, Brandon Rachal, Elijah Joiner, Jeriah Horne, Darien Jackson, and more. Many talented, NBA-level, players. But the results over that six-year stretch were generally disappointing, to put it lightly.

<br />

Looking at the chart above, there was just one definitively good season after 2015-16, an average KenPom ranking of 124, consistently declining attendance, and a particularly bad two-year stretch over these most recent seasons.

In Haith's defense, that definitively good 2019-20 season was indeed fantastic. Tulsa was the co-regular season AAC champion, Haith won AAC Coach of the Year, we would've likely received an NIT bid, and one of my single favorite memories from any TU game happened – Joiner hitting a three at the buzzer to take down Wichita State in front of a packed Reynolds Center.

But even during that 2019-20 year, the issues at the root of the program were still evident. Namely, attendance. [Bill Haisten noted](https://tulsaworld.com/sports/college/tu/after-a-20-loss-season-and-attendance-issues-tu-s-frank-haith-resigns/article_cc5cb176-a23c-11ec-85c4-1bdef3c69e16.html?utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=user-share) in his article about Haith's resignation that a new program low of 4,043 fans per game was set during that season. It has since cratered to an average of 2,911 this season. Doug Wojcik was fired for attendance issues almost exactly ten years ago.

Attendance problems aside, making the postseason just once over the past six years should not be acceptable. And not coming anywhere close in most of those seasons is worse. This year made it undeniable.

All-time low attendance, a program-worst 14 conference losses, and a lack of interest in the basketball program at large made it clear that it was time to go in a different direction.

More than anything else, though, this has to hurt for the players. Some, like Darien Jackson, have played for him throughout their entire college careers. They like and respect him as a man and as a coach. I imagine they may even feel a small sense of responsibility for Haith's resignation. It is them out there on the court, after all. And that sucks. Players should bear no responsibility for what happens with a coach.

I think we all know that Haith is a genuinely good man. I feel sad for him about this move. So before we get too down  here, let's take a quick look back at some of the good times.

<br />

#### Reminiscing

<br />

Despite the resignation, there have been some incredible moments during Haith's time leading the team.

To look back at some of these, I've compiled a few of my personal favorites as well as some notes from Darien Jackson, who we reached out to after the news about Haith's resignation came out.

Just a fantastic game from start to finish. Yes we lost, but it was the last go-round for Shaq, Woodard, and their crew. Matt and I both went to this game and had a blast.

#### Best Wishes & Closing

<br />

I have a ton of respect for Frank Haith. If he ever wants to come on the podcast, we'd love to have him. But it's time for a change. The program desperately needs new life. A coaching change can provide the activation energy that a university and a fanbase need in order to generate new interest and passion for the program. That's what I'm hoping for out of this move more than anything else. For people to care about Tulsa basketball again.

Matt and I just went on [The College Basketball Stories](https://linktr.ee/theCBBstories) podcast to talk about the 1980-81 Tulsa basketball season. Nolan Richardson had just been hired after Tulsa endured five-straight losing seasons. No one cared about the program then. At the end of that 1981 season, thousands of people welcomed the new NIT champions back to the Tulsa airport in the freezing cold at 2:00am. Several thousand more joined the NIT championship celebration in downtown Tulsa. All of this just one season after university administrators took a chance and made a change. It can happen. It will take someone who's hungry, who's outgoing, and who's willing to do whatever it takes to turn this ship around.

I wish nothing but the best for Coach Haith moving forward. He represented TU with class, dignity, and respect (and style) for eight years. He took pay cuts, weathered serious storms of instability throughout the university, and had moments of true greatness here. Unfortunately, the wins weren't consistent enough and he wasn't able to generate the level of excitement we're used to seeing around TU basketball. In today's game, that's enough to warrant a change.

So we move on. On to the next coach who will be the 31st head coach in Tulsa men's basketball history.

We may have another blog post out soon about who that could be, assuming the hire isn't made before we can write it.
